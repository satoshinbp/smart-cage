# smart-cage

Welcome to the smart-cage project! This project aims to create an intelligent and automated cage system for small pets, based on the powerful Raspberry Pi 5. With the smart-cage, you can ensure the well-being and safety of your furry friends through advanced automation and monitoring technologies.

## Features

- **Temperature monitor**: The cage is equipped with temperature sensors. The temperature is displayed in real-time on a 4-digit 7-segment LED display, ensuring you can always monitor the environment's comfort level.
- **Rotation counter**: This feature is designed to monitor the activity level of your pet by counting the number of rotations or movements within the cage. It's a great way to ensure your pet is getting enough exercise and to monitor their health and activity trends over time.
